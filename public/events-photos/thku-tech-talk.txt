Last Thursday, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Talk event organized by the University of Turkish Aeronautical Association EcoDrive Club.
We had an engaging discussion about DevOps, Google Cloud, and DevSecOps, sharing insights and exchanging ideas on these key topics.
A big thank you to the University of Turkish Aeronautical Association EcoDrive Club for hosting this event, and a special thanks to Eda Darmaz for her incredible efforts in making it happen! ðŸš€
