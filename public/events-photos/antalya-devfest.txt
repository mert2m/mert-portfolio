I was on stage at GDG Antalya DevFest!ðŸš€
I delivered my talk on "The Intersection of Cloud and AI: Google Cloudâ€™s Core Principles", sharing insights on how AI and Cloud technologies are shaping the future.
Iâ€™d like to thank the GDG Antalya team and Beyza Ã‡etin for organizing such an amazing event. ðŸŒŸ
Special thanks to Ersen DinÃ§, Erol Karakurt and AyÅŸegÃ¼l Ã–zer for their incredible support today.
